# Discontinuity

Discontinuous yet emergent 
realms of study:

0. Origin
1. Physics
2. Chemistry
3. Biology
4. Psychology
5. Sociology
6. Epistemology
7. Ontology
8. Beyond

Are these effectively mapped along 
a line or a circle? 

'0' and '8' are unknowable. 
Are they the same?

Is GÃ¶del's 2nd incompleteness 
theorem a factor, that a system cannot 
show its own consistency?
