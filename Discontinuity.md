# Conundrum

## Tangent Curve

Imagine a set of tangent curves side-by-side

- Elongated and flattened 'S' shaped
- Asymptotic boundaries and an inflection point in the middle
- Fuzzy conditions near non-overlapping non-touching boundaries
- No continuous transition from curve to curve

## Emergent Realms

X` - unknowable, before the start-of-time

A - Physics, mass and energy, time = 0 plus a bit

B - Chemistry, primarily molecules

C - Biology, primarily reproducing

D - Psychology, discerning, consciousness

E - Sociology, communing, self-consciousness

F - Epistemology, knowing, meta-consciousness

G - Ontology, being, silenced-consciousness

X`` - unknowable, after the end-of-time

## Interpretation

'1. We are at home in [F]
   - We are able to postulate and study [A] - [F]
   - Presume [F] relies on language and math
   - Presume that non-humans remain in [C] - [E]
'2. Through meditation many experience [G]
 - We return to [F] to convey the essence of [G]
'3. We propose a new emergent realm [X``]
- We speculate about the essence of [X``]
- We speculate about the essence of [X`]
- Both are unknowable
'4. Are [X`] and [X``] the same?
'5. How are emergent realms related?
- along a circle, or
- along a line
'6. Are the gaps between boundaries real?
- Is GÃ¶del's 2nd theorem a factor?
