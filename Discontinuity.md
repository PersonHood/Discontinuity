## Discontinuity

### Emergent Realms

Given nine successively emergent realms, each distinct from the prior and next realm.

Within any realm is it possible to necessarily project the next realm based on conditions in the present realm?

The realms are labeled as follows:

X' - unknowable
- before the start-of-time

A - Physics
- mass & energy, time = 0 + a bit

B - Chemistry
- primarily molecules

C - Biology
- primarily reproducing

D - Psychology
- primarily discerning, consciousness

E - Sociology
- primarily communing, self-consciousness

F - Epistemology
- primarily knowing, meta-consciousness

G - Ontology
- primarily being, silenced-consciousness

X'' - unknowable
- after the end-of-time?

### Nine Tangent Curves

Imagine a set of tangent curves:

- Side-by-side
- Elongated and flattened 'S' shapes
- Asymptotic boundaries
   - non-overlapping boundaries
   - non-touching boundaries
- Discontinuous curve-to-curve transitions
- An inflection point mid-curve

### An Interpretation

'1. We are at home in [F] epistemology
- We are able to postulate and study [A] - [F]
- Presume [F] relies on language and math
- Presume that most animals remain in [C] - [E]

'2. Through meditation many experience [G]
- We return to [F] to convey the essence of [G]

'3. We propose a new emergent realm [X'']
- We speculate about the essence of [X'']
- We speculate about the essence of [X']
- Both are unknowable

'4. Are [X'] and [X''] the same?

'5. How are emergent realms related?
- along a line, or
- along a circle

'6. Are the gaps between boundaries real?
- Are the gaps an artifact of linguistic limitations?
- Is GÃ¶del's 2nd theorem a factor?
